WinDEX is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange
for the DeFi ecosystem built on Substrate.

The goal of WinDEX is to create a fully decentralized platform for exchanging tokens in a peer-to-peer trustless environment built on Substrate, while additionally enabling high-liquidity, lightning-fast transaction speed and advanced trading features such as high-frequency trading and trading bots. WinDEX was bootstrapped by a Web3 Grant at the initial stage of the project to develop the original idea and was accepted as a member of Diamond Network and expected to be registered under DeFi Alliance in the near future.
